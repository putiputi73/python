#Toaday was kinda bored and decided that I calculate IRR for my client instead of doing it manually.
Given:

Initial premium (PV) = -$1,260,000
Annual payment (PMT) = $221,418
Duration (n) = 10 years
 The code generated is;
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

# Define the function whose root is the IRR
def npv_irr(rate):
    return -1260000 + sum([221418 / (1 + rate) ** t for t in range(1, 11)])

# Use fsolve to find the root of the function, which is the IRR
irr_solution = fsolve(npv_irr, 0.05)

# Print the Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
print("Internal Rate of Return (IRR): {:.2%}".format(irr_solution[0]))
